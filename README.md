# Why?
To save me bookmark space in my browser; and to a provide a personal, centralized resource while I learn systems programming and some web development. 

Also as a tool to learn version control on a small scale with Git. 

I take no credit for any resources listed and the authors of them should be supported directly. 

# Resources 

## Systems Programming

## TO-DO 
- Add more resources (obviously)
- Add concise descriptions for each link 
- Add resources unrelated to programming; learning sciences, productivity, etc. 
- Beautify Markdown syntax  
- Sync prog-lib & readme somehow; incredibly redundant

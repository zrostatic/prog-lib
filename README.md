# Why?
To save me bookmark space in my browser; and to a provide a personal, centralized resource while I learn systems programming and some web development. 

Also as a tool to learn version control on a small scale with Git. 

I take no credit for any resources listed and the authors of them should be supported directly. 

# Resources 

## Systems Programming

### Rust 
- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html) The central guide for Rust. 
- [Cheat Sheet](https://cheats.rs/) Cheat sheet for Rust syntax 
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) Learning Rust through example programs. 

### C
- [K&R C](https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Books/The%20C%20Programming%20Language%20(Kernighan%20Ritchie).pdf) The C bible.
- [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/) An alternative to K&R.
- [Makefiles](https://makefiletutorial.com/#the-essence-of-make) Applies to C/C++; demystifies makefiles. 

### C++
- [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com) A popular and concise resource for C++ 
- [C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) C++ language reference 

## x86 Assembly 
- [Fundamental Intro to Assembly](https://www.nayuki.io/page/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming)

## Web Development 

### TypeScript
- [Essential TypeScript](https://www.programming-books.io/essential/typescript/getting-started-fc960b9a93674d2a8ddb08e631981af5)

## Miscellaneous 

### Interpreters & Compilers

## Custom Lisp in C 
- [Build your own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/contents)
## Official Vulkan Tutorial 
- [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)

## TO-DO 
- Add more resources (obviously)
- Add better descriptions 
- Add resources unrelated to programming; learning sciences, productivity, etc. 
- Put all of this into a gitbook; will link to that shortly after
- Beautify Markdown syntax  
- Sync prog-lib & readme somehow; incredibly redundant
